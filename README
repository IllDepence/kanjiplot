USAGE:

- copy Anki's collection.anki2 file into kanjiplot folder
- run ./kanjiplot.sh
- a dialog will appear, choose your kanji deck
- view output.png


SCRIPTING:

- run ./kanjiplot.sh find
- a dialog will appear, choose a deck
- the <deck_id> will be printed
- run ./kanjiplot.sh <deck_id> for automated plotting


RAW KANJI LIST:

- run ./kanjiplot.sh with_raw_abs or ./kanjiplot.sh with_raw_rel
- additionally to output.png a file kanji_raw.dat will be created
- view index.html in your browser of choice (chromium requires flag --allow-file-access-from-files)


NOTE:

The script determines the number of kanji in your deck for every day you added at least one card, hence it will only work for self created decks where cards are added over time.


WINDOWS USERS:

- Use kanjiplot.bat instead of kanjiplot.sh
- Python and Gnuplot must be installed and available in the PATH before you run kanjiplot.bat
- You may have to edit the file kanjiplot.p to use another font if you don't have Dejavu Sans installed ("Tahoma" should work fine).
