USAGE:

- copy Anki's collection.anki2 file into kanjiplot folder
- run ./kanjiplot.sh
- a dialog will appear, choose your kanji deck
- view output.png


SCRIPTING:

- run ./kanjiplot.sh find
- a dialog will appear, choose a deck
- the <deck_id> will be printed
- run ./kanjiplot.sh <deck_id> for automated plotting


NOTE:

The script determines the number of kanji in your deck for every day you added at least one card, hence it will only work for self created decks where cards are added over time.
